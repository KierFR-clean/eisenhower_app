# EisenHower Matrix -- React + TypeScript + Vite!

Hi! I create this simple project during my past time this holiday season . The inspiration behind this is that I've using Eisenhower matrix to improve my productivity for the months and as I challenged to myself since I used the my 3 hours of free time since I'm also doing mentorship stuff to do this. The first plan was to just do a in-memory instead of using DB just to know if I can finish it within 3 hours before transitioning now to server-side and DB integration.
